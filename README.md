# Hi there, I'm Sadık Çoban 👋

**Statistics Student at Marmara University | TÜBİTAK STAR Researcher**

As a Statistics student, I am deeply fascinated by the mathematical foundations of models and the "stories" hidden in the details of data. I don't just build models; I strive to understand the underlying distributions and anomalies that others might overlook. 

My approach to Data Science is **Engineering-First**: I bridge the gap between statistical rigor and scalable software architecture, ensuring that every piece of code is modular, maintainable, and production-ready.

### 🚀 What I Bring to the Table
- **Statistical Modeling:** Passionate about deep-diving into model assumptions, ensemble learning, and fuzzy logic systems.
- **Architectural Mindset:** Applying software engineering principles (like N-Tier Architecture and Clean Code) to data science workflows.
- **Industrial AI:** Focused on human-in-the-loop systems and turning "imperfect" real-world sensor data into actionable insights.
- **MLOps & Reproducibility:** Building automated, orchestrated pipelines (Airflow) to move models from notebooks to production.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, CatBoost), R (Tidyverse, Package Development), SQL.
- **Engineering Foundation:** Background in C# and N-Tier architecture, applied to modular data system design.
- **Tools & Workflows:** Apache Airflow, Git, LaTeX, Docker (learning).

### 📊 Featured Projects
* **MFF (Meta Fuzzy Function):** An R package developed under academic supervision for the TÜBİTAK STAR program. The project focuses on integrating ensemble learning with fuzzy clustering-based meta-modeling to enhance predictive performance.
* **End-to-End Vehicle Pipeline:** A robust, Airflow-orchestrated regression pipeline designed for vehicle price estimation. It features automated data transformation and utilizes prediction errors as a diagnostic signal for identifying real-world data anomalies.
* **Synthetic Data & Regression Analysis:** A comprehensive statistical study involving the generation of synthetic datasets based on scraped automotive data. This project focuses on evaluating regression assumptions, handling non-normal distributions, and performing advanced model diagnostics.
