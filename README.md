**Statistics Student at Marmara University**

As a Statistics student, I am deeply fascinated by the mathematical foundations of models and the "stories" hidden in the details of data. I don't just build models; I strive to understand the underlying distributions and anomalies that others might overlook. 

My approach to Data Science is **Engineering-First**: I bridge the gap between statistical rigor and scalable software architecture, ensuring that every piece of code is modular, maintainable, and production-ready.

---

### 🚀 What I Bring to the Table
- **Statistical Modeling:** Passionate about building ML models and deriving insights from data.
- **Architectural Mindset:** Applying software engineering principles (like N-Tier Architecture and Clean Code) to data science workflows.
- **MLOps & Reproducibility:** Move models from notebooks to production.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, CatBoost), R (Tidyverse, Package Development), SQL.
- **Engineering Foundation:** Background in C# and N-Tier architecture, applied to modular data system design.
- **Tools & Workflows:** Git

### 📊 Featured Projects
* **[Meta Fuzzy Function (MFF)](https://github.com/nihattak/MFF):** An R package developed under academic supervision. The project focuses on integrating ensemble learning with fuzzy clustering to enhance predictive performance.
*  **[End-to-End Vehicle Valuation Pipeline](https://github.com/sadik-coban/car-price-prediction-pipeline):** A production-ready AI system for BMW & Audi market valuation. It replaces traditional regression with **CatBoost MultiQuantile forecasting** to provide reliable price intervals (). Features automated **idempotent data ingestion**, real-time **data drift monitoring** (KS/Wasserstein), and **SHAP-driven explainability**. Architected with a decoupled **Hugging Face Model Store** and a live **Next.js/FastAPI** dashboard.
* **Synthetic Data & Regression Analysis:** A comprehensive statistical study involving the generation of synthetic datasets based on scraped automotive data. This project focuses on evaluating regression assumptions, handling non-normal distributions, and performing advanced model diagnostics.
